## Eternally Thankful to Jodi Glickman for these words
### GIFT model

    
    generosity, 
    initiative, 
    forward momentum, and 
    transparencyâ€”to get ahead in your career.
    
    Most people don't love their job. It's this elusive goal that so many of us are chasing, and we never find, 
    looking for that dream job that you love. But we're barking up the wrong tree. 
    You shouldn't spend all of your time trying to find a job you love. Instead, 
    you should try and make people love you at work, every day, in every situation. 
    Because if I love you, I will do anything and everything in my power to help you succeed. 
    I will mentor you, I will sponsor you, I will champion your cause, I will give you great assignments, 
    I will pay you well, I will promote you, and you will love your job. 
    
    Here's the thing, if you love your job, you'll be better at it, and if you're better at your job, 
    then you'll like it more. It's a virtuous cycle, like your job more, be better at it. 
    Be better at your job, people like you or love you more.
